workflow
=======
1. makeasc - reformats our data files into something that's compatible with the UMASS software
	install python/python3
	todo: python3 consistency
2. question_acc
3. scripter2
4. make_cnt
5. fix_align
	install R and RStudio
	insert parameters
	added a line at the end that calls fix_align() function, and ran the script through the terminal (Rscript copy_fix_align.R)
	this takes a while
	tip: do not save  plots  as .tiff, it takes up all of the hard drive space
6. robodoc
7. dataanal
	these programs can't be used with any modern compilers or with linux (only windows)
	ANALASC.doc seems to be the README equivalent for the folder
	it looks like we want to use eyedry -- so see eyedry_doc.doc in particular
