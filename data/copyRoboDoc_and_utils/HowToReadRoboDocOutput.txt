How to read a .da1 file

Col1	Trial number including questions as trials
Col2	Condition number, for critical items SRC=1, ORC=2
Col3	Item number
Col4	Total time on screen
Col5	gamepad response (5=next screen, 0=timed out, 6= left trigger, 7=right trigger)
Col6	Number of fixations in the trial

Every fixation results in four columns of data
Col7	the number character that this fixation is on (-1 if outside the sentence)
Col8	the line that this fixation is on (0 if on the first line)
Col9	the ms from the beginning of the trial to the onset of this fixation
Col10   the ms from the beginning of the trial to the end of this fixation

These columns get repeated for each subsequent fixation
